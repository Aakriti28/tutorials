    "\n",
    "So far we have looked at some interesting features that Python and some of its packages have to offer. We had a glimpse of the power of NumPy and Matplotlib. These are perhaps very versatile packages and find use at a lot of places. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the scope for astronomical data analysis is very vast and is only getting wider with time. Since Python is the  primary programming language that astronomers prefer, some went on to make packages relevant to astronomy. What if all such packages could be found together under one umbrella? Well, the **Astropy Project** is the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Astropy](https://www.astropy.org/) is an open-source and community-developed Python package, with the first public version released in [2013](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2013/10/aa22068-13/aa22068-13.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of Astropy is to provide core astronomy-related functionality to the community, including support for domain-specific file formats such as flexible image transport system (FITS) files, common ASCII table formats, unit and physical quantity conversions, physical constants specific to astronomy, celestial coordinate and time transformations, world coordinate system (WCS) support, generalized containers for representing gridded as well as tabular data, and a framework for cosmological transformations and conversions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To know more about Astropy, you can check out the latest documentation [here](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/).\n",

    "To begin with, we shall look at the ease of reading and writing files using `astropy.table`"

The dimensions of this camera are 4108x4096, indicating the number of individual pixels that collect data i.e. photons. CCDs are particularly popular because of their linear response to light, meaning that the reading of each pixel is linearly proportional to the number of photons falling on this pixel. Hence, the array of numbers that is stored in a FITS file is basically a map of how many photons are incident where.\n",
