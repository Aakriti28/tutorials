    "# Functions in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Till now, we have seen quite a few functions (especially in [Tutorial 2](https://github.com/krittikaiitb/tutorials/tree/master/Tutorial_2)). The question arises then on what exactly a fuction is and if we can define functions of our own. This tutorial will use what we have learnt of Python and Numpy and help us take it a step further with user defined functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "A function is simply a piece of code that performs a task, for which it might take some input(s) and might return some output(s) (This will of course depend on the task). The input (and the output) could be a number, an array, a string etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "So why do we need such a thing? If there is a function to evaluate a polynomial at a given point, then we can just code it normally. The answer is robustness. \n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from just being correct, codes should ideally be robust, efficient, easy to debug, and of course, self explanatory for someone else reading it. Functions are very important for acheiving all of the above, with utmost simplicity. Functions are also very useful if you want the same task to be performed repeatedly, with no changes, or maybe with minor modifications. For example, if you want to evaluate that polynomial repeatedly, then it is better to define a function to do so, otherwise simple typing mistakes in one of those lines might break your code. Or if you want to now change your polynomial coefficients, and you have 100 repetitions of the code, then you'll have to go line by line to each of those. \n",
    "\n",
    "In short, functions eventually make your code easier to read and modify, and make it much easier to debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following references should be useful:\n",
    "https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions and https://scipy-lectures.org/intro/language/functions.html for exhaustive description on functions.\n",
    "And of course, Google."

    "Now lets try our hands out at some problems. Your mission, should you choose to accept it is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a 'galaxies.csv' file for the galaxies observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey(SDSS) - Mapping Nearby Galaxies At Apache Point Observatory(MaNGA). The file contains basic properties of each galaxy observed, namely  the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. mangaid - The unique identification number for each galaxy\n",
    "2. objra (in degrees) - The right ascension of the galaxy\n",
    "3. objdec (in degrees) - The declination of the galaxy\n",
    "4. redshift - The observed redshift in the spectra of the galaxy\n",
    "\n",
    "Right Ascension and Declination are just a set of coordinates used to describe positions of objects in the sky in astrophysics. They are just like how you describe a place on earth by its Longitude and Latitude. To know more, visit: https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-resources/right-ascension-declination-celestial-coordinates/\n",
    "\n",
    "The redshift describes how much the spectrum of a galaxy is shifted with respect to when the galaxy is stationary with respect to us. From elementary physics, we know that the apparent wavelength of an object moving away from us is larger than its actual wavelength( wavelength as seen from the object's rest frame), and this phenomena is called redshift. And vice versa for an object moving towards us, and this phenomena is called blueshift. To know more, check out: https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/What_is_red_shift\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, for galaxies that are located reasonably far away (like the galaxies observved by SDSS-MaNGA), we can assume that the redshift is primarily caused due to the expansion of space itself (Yes!!! we have entered the realm of cosmology), so we can use cosmological relations to calculate the distances to these objects, given their redshifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute the distance to a galaxy, in suitable units, given the galaxy's mangaid.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Compute the number density (number per unit volume) of galaxies observed by SDSS-MaNGA, in some given redshift interval. (Note: The maximum redshift observed by SDSS-MaNGA ~ 0.15)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Compute the physical separation between two galaxies, given their mangaid's. Note: The two galaxies might be at different radial distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to use function based implementation to solve the above tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the following information:\n",
    "1. Hubble's Law: The law specifies the rate of expansion of the universe. It was first observed by Edwin Hubble in the early 1900s. The law states: $$v = H_o \\times d$$, where v is the speed of the source at which it is moving away relative to the observer, and H0 is the hubble constant (you can take it to be 70 Km/s/Megaparsec) d is the instantaneous distance between the source and the observer. To know more about this law, check out: https://www.pnas.org/content/112/11/3173\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. $$v = z \\times c$$, where v is defined earlier, c is the speed of light and z is the redshift. This is an approximate relation, valid for z<<1. Almost all redshifts observed by SDSS-MaNGA are less than 0.15, hence you can use this relation as an approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The angular separation between two objects, given their RA and DEC: $$ \\theta = \\arccos(\\sin(\\delta_1)\\sin(\\delta_2) + \\cos(\\delta_1)\\cos(\\delta_2)\\cos(\\alpha_1 - \\alpha_2)) $$, where $\\delta_1$ and $\\delta_2$ denotes the declination of the two objects respectively, $\\alpha_1$ and $\\alpha_2$ denotes the right ascension of the two objects respectively, and $\\theta$ denotes the angular separation between them. The above relation can be derived using laws of spherical trigonometry. If you are interested in a derivation, you can check out: http://www.castor2.ca/07_News/headline_062515.html\n",
    "\n",
    "4. We are assuming that the redshifts are small enough that the non linear cosmological effects are negligible.\n",
