# Tutorials
Set of Jupyter Notebooks, along with datafiles, to get started with Scientific Computing in Astronomy  



## Ways to setup Jupyter notebooks 
While Jupyter runs code in many programming languages, Python is a requirement (Python 3.3 or greater, or Python 2.7) for installing the classic Jupyter Notebook.

### Windows
#### Installing python
All the notebooks (.ipynb) would have python version >= 3.6. I recommend you to use the same version of python to avoid compatibilty issues.  
Install python from https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.2/Python-3.8.2.tar.xz.  

#### Using Conda or Miniconda
Install Anaconda (it has almost all python packages) from https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/.
(Read the instructions carefully)  
Then open command prompt or windows shell (press windows button and type 'cmd')  
Enter the following command to install Jupyter notebook  
> conda install -c conda-forge notebook;

### Linux distribution




Using python-pip

Using Virtual environment
If you are already using python and have requirement of different python package version then Virtual environment.
It is helpful for future projects in different versions of python.
